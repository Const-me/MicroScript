This project demonstrates how to use modern C++ to implement a script engine that marshals function calls from interpreted script into native code.

Only tested on Windows 10 / Visual Studio 2017, also on MS Linux / clang / libc++. To build for linux, run "cmake ." followed by "make"

Should be easy to port to any other C++/17 compiler.
